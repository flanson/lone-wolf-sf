<div class="frontmatter">

 <p>You are Lone Wolf—last of the Kai Lords. A voyage to Vassagonia promises an end to the shadow of war. But hopes are soon shattered upon your arrival at Barrakeesh—a city full of treachery and death.</p>

 <p>In <strong><cite>Shadow on the Sand</cite></strong>, you are the quarry of a sinister foe, determined to kill you at all costs. Choose your skills and your weapons carefully. They can help you survive and aid you in the quest for a lost Sommlending treasure—a treasure that contains the secret of your destiny.</p>

 
     <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


    <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.</p>

  <p>Gary was working as a children’s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain’s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>

  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>

  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model maker.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>You are Lone Wolf—last of the Kai Lords of Sommerlund, and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed them during a bitter war with your age-old enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
<p>It is midwinter in your northern homeland and a mantle of snow lies knee-deep in the streets of Holmgard—the capital—when you are summoned from your monastery in the hills by a messenger bearing a scroll, signed and sealed by the hand of King Ulnar. You are surprised to read the King’s message, for it is a request for your help in solving an urgent problem of what he describes as ‘great diplomatic importance’. It seems a strange request to make of a warrior lord, whose skills are better suited to the field of battle than to parleying with foreign envoys. However, you obey the summons and upon your arrival at the capital, all is made clear.</p>
<p>The Zakhan of Vassagonia, the imperial ruler of this desert empire, has sent his most trusted envoy to seek a treaty of peace between your two countries, and you have been asked to sign the treaty on behalf of your country. The reason for this is easily apparent.</p>
<p>Less than a year ago, a renegade noble of Vassagonia called Barraka led his army of bandits in an attack upon the Sommlending province of Ruanon. This mining town and much of the surrounding land was overrun and destroyed. Many Sommlending lost their lives, and many more were enslaved and forced to labour in the mines of the Maaken Range. When the regular convoy from Ruanon failed to arrive at the capital, the king sent you to investigate. A great battle ensued in which you defeated Barraka in mortal combat. Without your courage and skill, the safety of Sommerlund and all of the Lastlands would have been placed in grave peril.</p>
<p>‘Your majesty, the Zakhan is gravely embarrassed by Barraka’s foul treachery, and is most anxious that our friendship and trust be restored. He begs that you send the Kai warrior, Lone Wolf, to sign a treaty of peace with him at the Grand Palace in Barrakeesh,’ whimpers the Zakhan’s emissary, as he kneels at the feet of King Ulnar.</p>
<p>The king rises from his throne, barely able to conceal his distaste for the fawning envoy. He turns his gaze to you and bids you follow him to the privacy of an antechamber.</p>
<p>‘I have no liking for this desert realm, Lone Wolf, but I like the prospect of war even less. The Zakhan is old and frail, and has no son to claim his throne when he dies. Barraka was but one of many ruthless nobles who wait like jackals for the chance to seize power, and I fear they grow too impatient to allow the Zakhan to die a natural death. The treaty may not guarantee peace with Vassagonia once the Zakhan is dead, but it will at least buy us precious time to strengthen our southern border.’</p>
<p>The king leads you to a window and points towards the harbour, barely visible through the falling snow. A Vassagonian galley lies anchored close to the harbour wall.</p>
<p>‘Go to Vassagonia, Lone Wolf. Sign the treaty and return quickly. Even with the promise of peace, I fear the shadow of war will fall upon us before the year is out.’</p>
<p>You wave farewell to Holmgard on this bleak midwinter’s day, feeling sure you will return before the thaw. But as you watch the spires of Holmgard disappear in the falling snow, you have no inkling of the shadow that awaits you in Vassagonia.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on 4 in the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you will already have your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, and Kai Disciplines which you can now carry over with you to Book 5. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>You may choose one bonus <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#discplnz">Kai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure you have successfully completed; now read the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#equipmnt">section on equipment</a> for Book 5 carefully.</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Kai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are taught to all Kai Lords. You have learnt only five of the skills listed below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="camflage">Camouflage</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Kai Lord to blend in with his surroundings. In the countryside, he can hide undetected among trees and rocks and pass close to an enemy without being seen. In a town or city, it enables him to look and sound like a native of that area, and can help him to find shelter or a safe hiding place.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Camouflage’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hunting">Hunting</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Lord will never starve in the wild. He will always be able to hunt for food for himself except in areas of wasteland and desert. You are aware that most of Vassagonia is arid desert; should your adventure lead you into this desert, the opportunities for successful hunting may not arise. But this skill is still very useful for it also enables a Kai Lord to move with great speed and dexterity.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Hunting’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="sixthsns">Sixth Sense</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Lord of imminent danger. It may also reveal the true purpose of a stranger or strange object encountered in your adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Sixth Sense’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="tracking">Tracking</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to make the correct choice of a path in the wild, to discover the location of a person or object in a town or city and to read the secrets of footprints or tracks.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Tracking’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="healing">Healing</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline can be used to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in combat. If you possess this skill you may restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point to your total for every numbered section of the book you pass through in which you are not involved in combat. (This is only to be used after your <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) Remember that your <small>ENDURANCE</small> cannot rise above its original level.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill write ‘Healing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wepnskll">Weaponskill</a></h4>

<p>Upon entering the Kai Monastery, each initiate is taught to master one type of weapon. If Weaponskill is to be one of your Kai Disciplines, pick a number in the usual way from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>, and then find the corresponding weapon from the list below. This is the weapon in which you have skill. When you enter combat carrying this weapon, you add 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="278" width="386" src="./1_5_files/weapons.png"><br><br></div><p>The fact that you are skilled with a weapon does not mean you set out on the adventure carrying that particular weapon. However, you will have opportunities to acquire weapons in the course of your adventures. You cannot carry more than 2 weapons.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponskill in _______ +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points if this weapon carried’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindshld">Mindshield</a></h4>

<p>The Darklords and many of the evil creatures in their command have the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Kai Discipline of Mindshield prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindshield: no points lost when attacked by Mindblast’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mndblst">Mindblast</a></h4>

<p>This enables a Kai Lord to attack an enemy using the force of his mind. It can be used at the same time as normal combat weapons and adds two extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Not all the creatures encountered on this adventure will be harmed by Mindblast. You will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlknsp">Animal Kinship</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to communicate with some animals and to be able to guess the intentions of others.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Kinship’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindomtr">Mind Over Matter</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Discipline enables a Kai Lord to move small objects with his powers of concentration.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mind Over Matter’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed Books 1–4 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, completion of Book 5 will raise you to the rank of Kai Master. This means that you will have acquired all ten basic Kai skills.</p>
<p>All of the Special Items that you have found and kept during your adventures, may then be used in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> ‘Magnakai’ series, which begins with Book 6 entitled <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/06tkot/title.htm#title"><cite>The Kingdoms of Terror</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before leaving Holmgard on your voyage to the Vassagonian capital of Barrakeesh, you are given a <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#map">map of the desert empire</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>. Now add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you may now enter this number in the Gold Crowns section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>. (If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total of any Crowns you may already possess. Remember you can only carry a maximum of fifty Crowns.)</p>
<p>You may take your pick of the following items (in addition to those you already possess, but remember you may only carry two weapons). You may take up to four of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dagger (Weapons)<br><br>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="./1_5_files/dagger.png"><br><br></div></li>
<li>Potion of Laumspur (Backpack Items). This potion restores 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for one dose.<br><br>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="./1_5_files/laumspur.png"><br><br></div></li>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br><br>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="120" width="386" src="./1_5_files/sword.png"><br><br></div></li>
<li>Spear (Weapons)<br><br>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="87" width="386" src="./1_5_files/spear.png"><br><br></div></li>
<li>2 Special Rations (Meals). Each of these Special Rations counts as one Meal, and each takes up one space in your Backpack.<br><br>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="./1_5_files/food.png"><br><br></div></li>
<li>Mace (Weapons)<br><br>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="./1_5_files/mace.png"><br><br></div></li>
<li>Shield (Special Items). This adds 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> when used in combat.<br><br>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="./1_5_files/shield.png"><br><br></div></li>
</ul>
<p>List the four items that you choose on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect it may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points or <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You don’t need to make notes but you can refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty crowns.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> is given capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill and the correct weapon, it adds 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember you can only carry two weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at any time.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it. If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, you may already possess Special Items. Before you begin <cite>Shadow on the Sand</cite>, you may choose to leave any or all of these items in ‘safekeeping’ at your Kai Monastery in Sommerlund. Special Items in ‘safekeeping’ cannot be used, but neither can they be lost during your adventure.<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Sommerlund and Vassagonia is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Whenever you kill a creature and search the body, you may take any Gold Crowns that you find and put them in your Belt Pouch.<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Kai Discipline of Hunting as one of your five skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat (unless you are in an area of desert where the opportunity for hunting is limited).<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br><br>

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.<br><br>
Example<br><br>
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast, to which the Winged Devil is not immune, so he adds 2 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 17.<br><br>
He subtracts the Winged Devil’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3. (17 − 20 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br><br>
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br><br>
Example<br><br>
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as -3. If the number taken from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
<li>Winged Devil loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br><br>
</li>
<li>On the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br><br>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Kai Training</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles that are bestowed upon Kai Lords at each stage of their training. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series, you will gain an additional Kai Discipline and gradually progress towards mastery of the ten basic Kai Disciplines.</p>

</div><div class="frontmatter">
<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Kai Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>Your mission is one of peaceful diplomacy—but beware! The desert empire of Vassagonia is notorious for being a land of deceit and treachery. Be on your guard at all times. Also, make notes as you progress, as you will find they will be of great help in future adventures.</p>
<p>Many things that you find will aid you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>If this is your first <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure, choose your Kai Disciplines with care—a wise choice and a great deal of courage should enable anyone to complete both parts of this adventure, no matter how weak his or her initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this book.</p>
<p>May the spirits of your Kai Masters guide you on your perilous adventure.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>For twenty-five days, the Vassagonian galley sails on a steady course for its home port of Barrakeesh, with only a brief stop at the Durenese harbour of Port Bax to break a safe but monotonous voyage.</p>
<p>You use your time aboard the ship to good purpose, learning the Vassagonian language from the ship’s crew. They are only too eager to teach you, asking only in return tales of your adventures in the Lastlands—for many of the sailors, these are the most exciting stories they have ever heard. By the time you reach Barrakeesh, you have both mastered their language and won their respect.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="./1_5_files/small1.png"><br><br></div><p>It is early afternoon when the ramparts of the desert capital are first sighted on the horizon. You push your way through the cheering crew, and join the envoy at the prow of the ship. Beaming with pride, he hands you a telescope and invites you to view the land of his birth. The sight is indeed breathtaking. You stare in fascination at the golden domes, minarets, and green-tiled roofs shimmering beneath the desert sun, and marvel at the splendour of the Grand Palace, which dominates this magnificent city. Then you notice that from every golden turret of the palace flutters a long, black pennant. You ask the envoy of the meaning of the black flags. Horror floods across his face as he snatches the telescope from your hands. ‘By the spirit of the Majhan! He is dead…The Zakhan is dead!’</p>
<p>As the bad news spreads through the ship, you pray that the peace treaty will be signed and honoured by the Zakhan’s successor. However, the envoy is less than hopeful.</p>
<p>The harbour of Barrakeesh is deserted save for a handful of citizens clad in black, and the only sound that greets you is the toll of a funeral bell, echoing through the harbour on this day of mourning. Then a horse-drawn carriage enters the harbour square, escorted by the cavalry of the Palace Guard. It halts, and a dour man in turquoise robes steps out to meet you.</p>
<p>‘A thousand greetings, Lone Wolf, I am Maouk, and I welcome you to our city on behalf of my master, his most sublime magnificence, Zakhan Kimah.’</p>
<p>The envoy gasps upon hearing the name of the new Zakhan. He turns to speak, his eyes wild with fear. ‘It is a trap, you must…’</p>
<p>His warning is cut short by the blade of Maouk’s dagger. Suddenly, scores of black-clad warriors emerge from the shadows; they are Sharnazim, élite Vassagonian bodyguards. They close in, surrounding you on every side. You must act quickly if you are to survive this deadly trap.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>Breathless from the exertion of combat, you step back as the Elix finally collapses and dies. Slowly, its glass-green eyes mist over and become opaque like hard, cold jadin. Around the creature’s blood-spattered throat hangs a Gold Key on a chain. You quickly discover that the Gold Key opens the steel door of a strongroom at the far end of apothecary.</p>
<p>High upon a shelf, just inside the door, you find a small box that contains what you seek—the Oede herb. Within seconds of pressing the beautiful golden leaves to your wounded shoulder, a tingling sensation engulfs your whole arm. The numbness soon fades, and both your arm and shoulder are free of the horrific Limbdeath microbes.</p>
<p>Sufficient Oede herb remains in the box for one further application. It is a powerful substance that can be used against many deadly diseases or alternatively can be used to restore 10 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points if swallowed after combat. If you wish to keep the Oede herb, mark it on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item. You should also restore the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points that were temporarily lost due to Limbdeath.</p>
<p>After dragging the dead Elix into the strongroom, you lock the steel door from the inside. You notice that there are in fact two doors to the strongroom: the one by which you entered and a smaller door set into the opposite wall. The Gold Key opens the lock of the new door, which leads to a narrow staircase beyond, dimly lit by flaring torches in wall brackets.</p>
<p>The climb is steep and arduous. You suspect that these steps are part of a secret route to the strongroom, and your suspicions are only confirmed when you arrive at what appears to be a dead end. A closer examination reveals a narrow bronze door set flush to the wall, plain in appearance except for a tiny key hole close to the floor. As you insert and twist the Gold Key, you are quietly confident that the bronze door will open.</p>

<p>In the robe of the dead blowpipe warrior, you find a small piece of parchment upon which is written today’s date and the number 67. A smile creeps across your face as you realize that this is the number that will open the bronze door.</p>

<p>You channel all your Kai skill into detecting the number that will open the door; it is a strenuous task, and one that demands great concentration. Gradually, the image of two numbers—six and seven—begin to form in your mind. The image is hazy, and you’re not sure if the number is sixty-seven or seventy-six. You are exhausted by your efforts, and they have cost you 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.

<p>The guard begins to cough. He pleads with you to slacken your grip or he will choke to death. You ask him one more question: does he know where your confiscated equipment is?

<p>The outer wall of the Grand Palace is far too high to climb, and even if you had a rope long enough, your green Kai cloak would be seen for miles, set against the white, sun-bleached marble wall.</p>
<p>You crouch in the shadow of a doorway while you concentrate on working out a plan. There is a constant traffic of mounted scouts and couriers from the north gate. Those arriving hand a scroll of parchment to two of the guards before they enter. Slowly, a bold plan begins to take shape in your mind. If you could overpower one of the couriers before he reaches the palace gate, you could disguise yourself in his clothes and use his scroll to gain entrance.</p>
<p>Many of the couriers approach the Grand Palace from the harbour, and although it is infested with troops, you discover the ideal place to ambush a rider. There is a broad avenue where a bridge of gnarled old wood and metal curves over the street, and here, beneath the wooden arch, you lie in wait for your prey.</p>
<p>Your chance soon arrives; a black-robed rider enters the avenue and spurs his horse along the street. He will have to pass beneath the arch. You prepare to pounce.</p>

<p>A slippery ladder disappears into the dark, stench-filled shaft. You gulp a lungful of air and climb down, locking the trapdoor behind you. When you finally reach the bottom of the shaft, your worst fears are confirmed.</p>
<p>You have entered the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</i>, the main drainage sewer of Barrakeesh.

<p>Hurrying down the steps and away from the Bath Hall, you enter the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">‘Saadi-tas-Ouda’</i>: the Square of the Dead. Jet-black flagstones cover the square, each with a long iron spike set deep into its centre. From the Bath Hall steps, the square resembles the back of a massive iron porcupine, but when you reach the base of the steps, you realize that the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Saadi-tas-Ouda</i> is in fact far more sinister.</p>
<p>Stuck on top of each spike is a human skull—all that remains of pirates, murderers, traitors, and thieves who have been sentenced to death. The grisly display serves as a warning to others never to defy the law of the Zakhan.</p>

<p>The temperature rises steadily until you are bathed in sweat. Ahead, you see a chamber filled with steam that rises from its bubbling floor. You are about to enter the chamber when you catch a glimpse of the danger awaiting you; the stone walkway ends abruptly, only a few yards into the chamber. Ten feet below, lying before you like the surface of a huge bubbling cauldron, is a <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">tar-sorkh</i>: a mud geyser.</p>
<p>These geysers are common in Vassagonia. Much of the desert empire is unstable, but although it is subject to constant earth tremors, it rarely results in great destruction. The Vassagonians call these tremors: <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">‘Tasa-Dophiem’</i>, which means ‘The Wrestling Gods’.</p>
<p>This particular mud geyser has been put to practical use. It provides a constant source of heat for the dwellings built over the chamber. The steam from the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">tar-sorkh</i> rises into a pair of huge, circular chimneys in the domed ceiling, which in turn feed heat to the buildings above.

<p>You wake up in great discomfort; every muscle of your body feels knotted and bruised. You force open eyelids clogged with dried sweat, and look with dread at your wretched surroundings. You are lying on the hard stone floor of a prison cell. Over by the far wall, beneath a window criss-crossed with iron bars, is a low wooden bunk covered in filthy rags. Cockroaches, some the size of field mice, scuttle along a foul-smelling gutter that disappears into a grating in the floor.

They come to halt outside the cell door and a loud voice bellows out: ‘Sleeping on duty, Sefrou? You’ll wake up on the other side of this door if the captain catches you!’</p>
<p>The chair scrapes along the ground, and a startled voice, full of indignation, replies: ‘Curse you, Hadj! The Zakhan doesn’t want the Northlander taken to the Grand Hall until sunset. You’ve cheated me of two hours sleep.’</p>
<p>‘Shut up, Sefrou,’ snarls the first voice, ‘and listen hard. I’ve just come from the armoury. Some interesting trinkets were found on the Northlander, worth a great deal of gold I’d say. Seems a pity to let them go to waste, eh?’</p>

<p>‘I’ll take a peek at our friend,’ says one of the guards. ‘I wonder if he’s enjoying our hospitality.’</p>

<p>You press on for about a mile until you can go no further: a huge iron grating blocks the tunnel. The decomposing carcass of a giant lizard has been washed up against the bars. Bones are clearly visible where the dead flesh has rotted or been eaten away. The bars are firmly fixed; it will be impossible to continue in this direction.</p>
<p>Close to the dead lizard, a narrow stone platform juts out from the wall. Beyond a platform, you notice a low arch leading to some stairs, ascending out of the sewer.</p>

Beyond the antechamber is another hall, this time crowded with people, some seated, others standing, and everyone busy in conversation. These are the free baths of Barrakeesh and the citizens of the capital are justly proud of them. They are the envy of the other desert cities where water is scarce and precious. The citizens treat the baths as a forum, a place for meeting and talking with friends. Much of the conversation you overhear is about the new Zakhan; few speak well of him.</p>

<p>The marble door opens into semi-darkness, and the musty smell of old parchment wafts through the air. Row upon row of neatly stacked, leather-bound books stand upon marble shelves, each one of which is beautifully decorated with intricate arabesques in fine gold leaf. Judging by the dates and inscriptions, you deduce that these books form a catalogue of all the treasures in the Grand Palace, many dating back hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Every shelf of the small library is filled with books, every shelf, that is, save one where, on a purple silk cloth, lie a Copper Key and a Prism. If you wish to take either, or both, of these items, mark the Prism as a Backpack Item and the Copper Key as a Special Item (which you carry in your pocket) on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>There is no exit from the library other than the marble door by which you entered. After satisfying yourself that nothing useful has been overlooked, you close the door and walk back along the corridor. When you reach the junction, you see a patrol of palace guards ascending the stairs. Without a moment’s hesitation, you run towards the east door to avoid being seen.</p>

<p>The man screams and keels over, writhing on the floor for a few moments before exhaling his last breath. Meanwhile, his partner has scrambled to his feet, forgetting his weapon in his hurry to escape along the passage. You give chase, pausing only to snatch up the discarded trident; you know you must stop him before he warns other guards. You draw back the trident and throw. It strikes him squarely in the back, pitching him forward as it makes impact. He is dead before he hits the floor.</p>
<p>A search of the dead bodies uncovers the following items:</p>
<ul>

<p>‘Welcome, Northlander. I sense you are a warrior—or am I mistaken?’ As you hesitate to answer, she shrugs her shoulders and searches through a pile of parchments stacked on top of a wine casket. She blows away the dust before handing you a yellowed sheet. It is a list of merchandise, written in Sommlending:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potion of Alether (increases <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> by 2 for the duration of 1 combat)—4 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Potion of Gallowbrush (induces sleep for 1–2 hours per dose)—2 Gold Crowns</li>

<p>You may purchase any of the above and in any quantity you desire; all potions, vials, and tinctures are Backpack Items. You then leave the shop and continue along the street.</p>

<p>From the view, you judge that this window is set high up in the south wall of the Grand Palace. Far below you can see the buildings of the capital, in miniature clusters inside the white city wall. To the southeast lies Lake Inrahim, an immense salt-water plain that is completely dry and cracked. To the east, a road stretches across the causeway to the town of Chula, just visible on the horizon. To the southwest lie the barren, sun-scorched Dahir Mountains and the shifting ocean of sand known as the Dry Main.</p>
<p>The bars of the window are badly corroded; it would be easy to dislodge them. However, the drop of several hundred feet to the city below means that there is no hope of escape this way. You climb down from the table and hurry along the corridor.</p>

<p>The house smells strongly of burnt incense.

<p>All hope of signing a peace treaty has long vanished, and your only concern now is to escape from the Grand Palace and, somehow, return home to Sommerlund as quickly as possible.

<p>Your desire to leave this treacherous city is overcome by your fear of losing your arm. You must get the Oede herb, even though it means you will have to enter the very place you are most anxious to avoid—the Grand Palace.</p>
<p>The alley follows a tortuous route through the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Mikarum</i>, finally leading you to the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">‘Horm-tas-Lallaim’</i>: the Tomb of the Princesses. Beyond the tomb, the Grand Palace rises like a massive white pantheon.</p>
<p>You suddenly recall a legend told to you by your Kai masters long ago: ‘The Nemesis of the Black Zakhan’. The Black Zakhan was a brutal tyrant, the cruellest of an evil lineage that ruled over the desert empire long ago. The barbaric excesses of his reign have never been forgotten in the Lastlands. The Grand Palace was built by his army of slaves, prisoners from countries he had conquered in war. The palace became his obsession; he personally oversaw its entire construction and punished the workers personally if there was the slightest delay. He butchered his subjects indiscriminately and in the most terrible fashion. His favourite form of execution was for the victim to be sawn in half from head to foot until the body fell in two pieces. However, it was the mass execution of the slaves who built the Grand Palace that made him infamous. He slaughtered every slave worker so that his enemies could never learn of the secret treasure chambers he had had constructed. Among the slaves were his only daughters, Kebilla and Sousse, who openly opposed their father’s cruelty and tried to prevent the executions. In a blind rage, he ordered that they should be the first to die.</p>
<p>It would have been better for the Zakhan, and for Vassagonia, if he himself had died that day. He lived for another two years, but his mind was unhinged by guilt, and he was tortured by self-loathing and despair. In the Grand Palace, the silence of the night was frequently broken by the Zakhan’s moans and cries, as he wandered from room to room looking for his daughters. When he died, he was laid beside them, here, in the Tomb of the Princesses.</p>
<p>From where you stand, you can see two entrances to the Grand Palace; a spike-topped gate in the north wall, and an arch in the west wall, blocked by an iron portcullis. The palace is usually heavily guarded, but there are very few guards today; most are searching for you in the city.</p>

<p>You recognize the creature; it is a Kwaraz, a giant, creeping reptile. Kwaraz are native to the Maakenmire swamp, hundreds of miles to the west of Vassagonia, but they thrive in any hot, damp, and fetid environment, and it strikes you that the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</i> sewer is an ideal breeding ground for these deadly beasts.

<p>Upon a raised platform, carpeted with scarlet fur, sits the Vassagonian Emperor, Zakhan Kimah. He is robed in gold but devoid of all ornamentation. In his hand is an orb of black metal, and in his eye an ice-cold cruelty that chills your spine. The Zakhan is a man of awesome countenance, but he pales in the shadow of his companion.</p>
<p>Before him stands the cause of your terror. A helm as black as death itself hides the face, but the stench of decay and a hideous sepulchral voice betray the identity.</p>
<p>‘Give me Lone Wolf!’</p>
<p>It is the fell voice of a mortal enemy—a Darklord of Helgedad. As the Zakhan rises to his feet, you notice a flicker of doubt, or perhaps of fear, dim his cruel gaze, but he is quick to mask it. ‘He will be brought to you at sunset in exchange for the Orb of Death. It is agreed.’</p>
<p>‘You have the Orb,’ echoes the chilling voice. ‘Give me Lone Wolf!’</p>
<p>The Zakhan hides his fear well, but time is not on his side. The game of bluff he is playing is deadly. However, the fact that he has not yet been discovered is evidence of his powerful will, for you sense the Darklord is persistently clawing and probing at his mind.</p>
<p>‘You will get your Northlander, Lord Haakon,’ says the Zakhan, his voice curt with anger, ‘when you tell me why your servants defile the Tomb of the Majhan. You claim to have no need for gold and jewels—why then do you plunder the graves of our ancestors?’</p>
<p>A deathly quiet fills the hall; only the unnatural hiss of the Darklord’s breath disturbs the silence. ‘This land, this insignificant speck of sand, harbours two small thorns that prick our skin. We seek to remove them both—forever. The fledgling Kai, Lone Wolf, is the thorn that denies us Sommerlund. The Tomb of the Majhan hides the other thorn that threatens us—the accursed <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>.’</p>
<p>Your heart pounds as the words echo in your head. The <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>! Suddenly, the reason why you have been enticed into a deadly trap becomes clear, and the sinister truth is revealed.</p>
<p>The <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> is one of the oldest legends of Sommerlund. With the wisdom of the Magnakai, Sun Eagle, the first Kai Grand Master, instilled the disciplines into the warriors of the House of Ulnar, the bloodline of your king, that were to save your land from devastation at the hands of the Darklords. The <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> was lost hundreds of years ago, but its wisdom was kept alive, handed down through generations of Sommlending warriors so that they could share the strength to resist their eternal enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
<p>If the Darklords discover and destroy the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>, the secrets will be lost forever, and when you die, the Kai will become extinct. However, if you discover the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> first and deny the Darklords their prize, all the wisdom of the Magnakai will be revealed to you. Through its wisdom you will become strong, strong enough to reach the ultimate achievement for a Sommlending warrior—to become a Kai Grand Master.</p>
<p>However, the peril and the glory of the quest that lies ahead are distracting you from more immediate danger. To discover this danger and to begin the quest for the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>, turn to Part Two of <cite>Shadow on the Sand</cite>.</p>

<p>There is no reply to your first knock. You are about to knock again when the door opens a few inches and the red-rimmed eyes of an old woman stare out from the darkness. ‘Banedon!’ she exclaims, her voice hoarse and shaky. ‘Thank the gods it is you.’</p>
<p>She ushers you both inside and locks the door. The house is sparsely furnished, and what little is there is either damaged or broken. ‘They have taken him, Banedon, they have taken my husband—the men with the faces of the dead. Ten days ago. They came like shadows in the night.’</p>
<p>She breaks down, her frail body wracked by sobs. Banedon comforts her as best he can, but you sense he shares her bitter loss. The Drakkarim have taken Tipasa, of that there is little doubt. By now they will have made him tell everything he knows about the Tomb of the Majhan.</p>
<p>‘We will find him, I promise,’ says Banedon, wiping the tears from the old woman’s face, ‘but you must try to help us if you can. Tipasa always kept a diary of his travels—do you have it still?’</p>
<p>A flicker of hope shines in the old woman’s eyes. ‘Yes, it is here. He told me to hide it when the evil men came for him.’</p>
<p>She kneels at an empty fireplace and prises a loose brick from the chimney; a leather-bound book drops from its hiding place into her hand. She gives it to Banedon who studies the yellowed pages, his face lined in thought. You notice that the book is full of cryptic symbols, numbers, and pictograms.</p>

<p>A terrible shriek rings out above the rush of the wind, filling your head with pain. You are being attacked by a powerful Mindblast. Unless you possess the Kai Discipline of Mindshield, deduct 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points from your current total.</p>
<p>The Itikar shudders and frantically twists its head from side to side as the shriek rings out again. You sense that the great bird is in agony, racked by the Mindblast. As you glance over your shoulder, your stomach becomes knotted with fear—a Kraan is swooping down to attack. On its back is your adversary: a Vordak, one of the undead and a hideous lieutenant of the Darklords. As the Kraan streaks towards you, the Vordak spreads its red-robed arms and leaps from the saddle. It lands behind you, astride the Itikar’s back, its skeletal fingers sunk deep into your mount’s feathered flesh. The shock of the impact throws you forward, and the reins slip from your hands.</p>
<p>The giant bird screeches in horror and pain as the Vordak’s grip paralyses its spine. You must act quickly, for the Itikar is now plummeting towards the salt-plain of Lake Inrahim.</p>

<p>You learn that the dwarves were once the crew of a more conventional vessel, a merchantman that sailed the Tentarias of southern Magnamund. The Tentarias is a vast expanse of lakes and land-locked seas, which connect to form a continuous canal stretching nearly three thousand miles. They were created, as was the Rymerift of Durenor, by a massive landslide. Three years ago, the dwarves’ former captain, a dwarf named Quan, lost his ship, cargo, and crew whilst gambling at cards; it seems the unfortunate captain was unaware of Banedon’s true profession until it was far too late. As a result, Banedon became the dwarves’ captain, and ever since they have adventured with him across the lands and skies of Southern Magnamund. The <cite>Skyrider</cite> itself was given to Banedon by the Magicians of Dessi, in return for his help in defeating the Gagadoth—a monstrous creature that terrorized their land, over which their own sorcery could not prevail.</p>
<p>The <cite>Skyrider</cite> was travelling from Dessi on its way to Barrakeesh when you appeared. The dwarves have overheard your talk with Banedon and are excited by the prospects of a new adventure. They seem undaunted by the deadly dangers that it will certainly involve.</p>

<p>You see the young magician lower his staff, a trace of a smile on his pain-racked face.</p>
<p>‘Alas, I was too slow to shield myself,’ he says wryly, as you kneel at his side and free the spear that pins him to the floor. The wound is serious, and you hastily staunch the bleeding with strips of cloth from his dark blue robes.</p>
<p>The wizard then introduces himself. ‘I am Banedon, Journeymaster to the Guild of the Crystal Star,’ he says, his voice weak and shaky. ‘However, you need not introduce yourself, Lone Wolf, for only you would attract such company this far from home.’ He glances at the Kraan-riders swooping past the skyship on every side. ‘Help me to my feet—we must escape before they drag us from the sky.’</p>

<p>The Onyx Medallion is beginning to glow and vibrate in your pocket. This Special Item, torn from the armour of a renegade Vassagonian captain during the battle of Ruanon, enables you to communicate with the Itikar. You reassure it that you mean no harm. Itikar are by nature wild and malicious creatures, but the power of the Onyx Medallion tames this natural instinct, subduing them to the wearer’s command.</p>
<p>As you settle in the wide saddle, you catch sight of the Drakkarim streaming across the gangplank. Quickly, you lean forward, unhook the Itikar’s anchor rope from the saddle ring and grab the thick leather reins.</p>

<p>Dawn is breaking on the horizon of a low hill, blurred and dotted with small tufted trees. Swiftly the <cite>Skyrider</cite> has voyaged through the night to arrive at the foothills of the Koneshi Mountains, in whose folds the skyship is safely tucked away from watchful eyes. Twenty-five miles to the north, across a landscape of barren rock and dry brush, lies the Tomb of the Majhan.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="./1_5_files/small3.png"><br><br></div><p>You and Banedon set off before the dawn, anxious not to waste either time or the protective cover of darkness. Now, as the great golden disc of the sun rises in the sky, for the first time you can see your goal. A massive excavation has exposed the heart of this scorched land, delving deep around the tombs of its forgotten ancestors. Thousands of Giaks, spiteful and malicious servants of the Darklords, labour unceasingly to remove rock and sand from this quarry, forced by Drakkarim to drag their backbreaking loads up ramps to the rim of the crater.</p>
<p>Close to the edge of the crater, an encampment of black tents surrounds a large domed canopy. Lying in the shade of this construction is a huge flying creature—an Imperial Zlanbeast. Its presence here can only mean one thing: Darklord Haakon has arrived. The thought chills your blood, but you draw comfort from the labour of his slaves. That they continue to labour is a sign that their mission has yet to be completed: the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> has yet to be found.</p>
<p>It is impossible to approach the crater unseen; you will have to wait for darkness before you attempt to enter the Tomb. During the long wait, it is agreed that Banedon should attempt to find Tipasa. It is likely that he is being held captive inside the encampment—the Darklords would be unlikely to kill him before discovering the treasure they seek.</p>

<p>The explosion is followed by a huge cloud of smoke, which engulfs a cabin perched on the rear deck. As the noise rumbles across the desolate salt-plain, you hear the agonizing shriek of a wounded Kraan; it spirals past the platform, a ragged hole rent in its broken wing.</p>

He is holding a tube of smoking steel that you assume to be a magic staff, until you notice that each of the dwarf crew carry identical staves. As they point them at the swooping Kraan, gouts of smoke and flame bellow from their tips. Suddenly you recognize the weapons and their wielders—they are dwarves from the mountain kingdom of Bor, armed with one of the inventions for which these ingenious artisans are justly famous throughout Magnamund.</p>
<p>The Kraan are terrified by the noise; they turn their leathery tails and fly away, their Drakkarim riders powerless to stop them. The primitive guns have claimed only one victim, but nevertheless, they have driven off the enemy and saved the skyship from disaster.</p>

<br><br></div><p>The golden domes of the Grand Palace grow smaller as the Itikar gathers speed. Soon, you have passed over the city wall and are heading out towards the shimmering salt-flats of Lake Inrahim. The land below is bathed in beautiful orange twilight, as the sun slowly sinks behind the Dahir Mountains to the west. Elated by your escape, you throw back your head and give voice to a triumphant yell that is carried away on the chill evening wind.</p>
<p>As if in answer to your cry, an echoing chorus of shrieks pierce the sky. Fear returns to your heart as you catch sight of a flock of Kraan, hideous leathery-winged fliers. Each carries a Drakkarim warrior on its back. They are over a mile behind you, but they are quickly closing the gap. Less than an hour of light remains; if you can evade them a little longer, you may be able to lose them when night falls.</p>

<p>The old man’s face is a mask of putrescent green sores. The pupils of his eyes are yellow, and his ragged grey lips hang in tatters. He suffers from vaxelus, an infectious disease that rots the skin and attacks the nerves, resulting in hideous mutilation and deformity.

<p>You glimpse the silhouette of Darklord Haakon in the hall below, his spiked fist raised. There is a deafening crack as a bolt of blue lightning streaks from a stone in the Darklord’s hand and hurtles towards you. You dive for cover behind the body of the Drakkar as the bolt explodes. In a flash of light, the Drakkar is gone. Only cinders and the rotten odour of scorched flesh remain.</p>
<p>You scramble to your feet and sprint along the passage. Another bolt hurtles from the hall, tearing into the ceiling with shattering effect. Splinters of razor-sharp marble whistle down, slashing your cloak and tunic. You race down some stairs, through a silver archway and along a balcony that overlooks the lower palace. A peal of bells and the crunch of iron-shod boots echo in your ears—the Zakhan has sounded the alarm, his guards close in on every side.</p>

<p>By the side of the street, an old man is selling assortment of rugs and carpets from the back of a wagon. Banedon approaches him and the two converse for several minutes. Finally, the wizard hands the old man a ring; his wrinkled face beams with joy. Banedon returns to you with good news.</p>
<p>‘The house with the blue door—at the end of the alley we passed a short while ago. Tipasa lives there.’</p>

<p>Wincing from the pain of your wound, you snatch the reins back and urge the Itikar to climb higher. The Drakkar is now over a hundred feet below, but he is bringing the shrieking Kraan around for another attack.</p>
<p>You wheel to the south to avoid being caught between the two converging squadrons of Kraan-riders. Your sudden change of direction increases the distance between you and your pursuers, but your feathered mount is badly wounded and you are close to despair; the Itikar is losing so much blood that it could become unconscious at any moment, and drop you like a stone onto the distant surface of Lake Inrahim below.</p>

<p>Suddenly, you catch sight of Banedon. His arm is raised above the armoured parapet of the platform, and in his hand he holds a slender blue rod. A torrent of water gushes from the rod, arcing into the sky to meet the deluge of liquid flame. There is a tremendous explosion as the elements collide, and a massive whirlpool of flame and water spirals towards the Vordak.</p>
<p>The Vordak shrieks with terror but it is too late—its fate is sealed. The whirlpool consumes the Zlanbeast and its rider in a massive burst of sun-like brilliance.</p>

It releases an awful howl of unearthly evil, pain, terror, and death. As it falls, its skeletal body dissolves into a smoking green fluid, shrivelling the plants on the ground beneath.</p>
<p>The Drakkarim hesitate as the golden light of the sun-sword glints on their shiny black death-masks; you see your chance and run straight at them, slashing to left and right. A Drakkar raises his shield, but your blade slices clean through the iron-sheathed wood, severing his arm at the shoulder. Wheeling round, you catch another Drakkar in mid-attack, tearing open his black armour with the sword as if it were merely parchment. He screams in agony, but you disappear into the dense foliage before his body falls lifelessly to the soft earth.</p>

<p>Inside, the mood is one of celebration. Tables have been drawn together to form a large semicircle in front of which stands a small, broad-shouldered man dressed lavishly in an embroidered costume. A gold-mounted sword hangs by his side, its blue velvet scabbard as vivid in colour as the man’s silk pantaloons. Affectionately, the man embraces his companions, kissing the friends and relatives who have travelled so many miles to celebrate his wedding. At his side sits his bride, her face concealed behind a veil of shimmering pearls. Suddenly, the tavern is filled with music as the guests take the floor for the wedding dance.</p>

<p>Beyond the portal lies a vaulted corridor leading to a grand stairway. You narrowly avoid confrontation with a dozen Drakkarim, saved by your lightning reactions. As the enemy rush from an archway on the second floor landing, you dive behind a statue of the recently deceased Zakhan Moudalla. They are so intent on their chase that they fail to notice your hiding place and hurry down the stairs, grunting in their heavy armour as they run. Silently, you give thanks that Zakhan Moudalla was a very stout man and that his statue casts a very large shadow in which to hide.</p>
<p>At the top of the stairway you discover a hatch, which gives access to the roof. You climb through it and follow a path of sun-bleached tiles that wind in and out of the domes and turrets, eventually leading to a bell-tower.</p>

<p>As far as the eye can see, a long, straight, sandstone corridor slopes away into the distance. Torches crackle and sputter on the walls, illuminating the pictograms engraved in the yellow stone.</p>
<p>At regular intervals, rough-edged slabs protrude into the main corridor. You stop to take a close look at one of these slabs and the floor beneath it and come to a frightening conclusion. They are obviously traps, no doubt set off by the Giaks when they cleared this corridor of sand. Rather than instructing the Giaks to avoid them, the Darklords must have deliberately used their slaves to set them off. Once the traps had been sprung, the squashed bodies were cleared away and the slabs chiselled through to the next section. Pit traps in the floors seem to have been neutralized in the same way. Set off by luckless Giaks, they would have been filled in with the dead bodies and levelled off with sand. The thought of this heartless barbarity fills you with revulsion.</p>
<p>Just over a mile along the corridor, you eventually arrive at a large stone door. The stone surround bears evidence of chisel-work, but the door itself is rock solid.</p>

<p>Inside the cool marble tower, two flights of spiral stairs meet at a landing. You detect the sound of distant running feet, gradually growing louder. It is coming from one of the spiral staircases, but which one? Suddenly, a band of Drakkarim warriors appear; they are crossing the bridge that leads to the tower. You must escape.</p>

<p>Banedon lowers his staff, the trace of a wry smile on his pain-racked face. ‘Alas, I was too slow to protect myself, Lone Wolf,’ he says, glancing at his arm. You kneel at his side and free the spear that pins him to the floor. The wound is serious; hastily you staunch the bleeding with strips of cloth torn from his dark blue robes. You recognize the robes, for they are the attire of a Journeymaster. It seems that young Banedon has achieved distinction among his brother magicians since last you met.</p>
<p>‘It appears that we are fated to meet in their company,’ he says, still watching the Kraan-riders anxiously. ‘Help me to my feet, we must escape before they drag us from the sky.’</p>
<p>You support the magician as he grasps the ship’s helm—a radiant crystal sphere with hundreds of glowing facets set on a slim silver rod. No sooner has his hand closed around the crystal than there is a tremendous explosion.</p>

<p>You examine the floor where Darklord Haakon fell, but there are no signs of his body. The atmosphere is strangely calm and peaceful, as if a great and evil shadow has been lifted. (If you lost the Sommerswerd in the confrontation with the Darklord, you may now retrieve it.)</p>
<p>You turn and walk to the throne where Haakon sat, waiting for you to appear. Beyond it lies a portal, an ancient inscription carved deep into the blood-red stone. Below the carving is set the impression of a human hand. Instinct and intuition guide your hand to the door; the carving fits around it like a glove.</p>

<br><br></div><p>Silently the portal slides back to reveal your destiny—the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>. Set on a pedestal, the book lies open, its secrets revealed to your eyes alone. As you lift the sacred book, the very air throbs with the vibration of the force locked within its sun-gold cover. With a pounding heart you close the book and hurry from the chamber.</p>
<p>By the time you reach the foothills of the Koneshi, Banedon has successfully completed his mission; he and Tipasa are waiting for you. As they see you appear, clutching the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>, they can barely contain their excitement.</p>
<p>‘This night of triumph,’ says Banedon, jubilantly, ‘will herald a new dawn of hope for Sommerlund. The Kai are reborn.’</p>
<p>The quest is now over. You have found the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> and freed Magnamund from the shadow of Darklord Haakon. But for you, Kai Master Lone Wolf, the story has only just begun.</p>
<p>Your destiny lies along the path of the Grand Masters. To learn their secrets and attempt the first exciting quest of the Magnakai, begin your journey with Book 6 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series entitled:</p>

<h3><a name="erruse">Note on Standard Usage</a></h3>

<p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
<li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
<li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
<li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
<li>adj: Liganim</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>

<h4><a name="lic-2-1">2.1</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators grant you the right to receive a copy or copies of the Internet Editions from the Distribution Point at no charge provided that you agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License. If you do not agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License, you are not granted any rights by this License.</p>
<p>You agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License by the act of receiving or viewing a copy of any portion of the Internet Editions even though you have not signed a written document. Indeed, you have no right to receive or view a copy or copies without first accepting this License as legally valid and binding and agreeing to the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-2">2.2</a></h4>

<p>You agree to refrain from redistributing a significant portion of the Internet Editions in any form, electronic or otherwise, to any other person or persons for any reason by any means. You are granted the right to receive a copy or copies only for your own personal use.</p>
<p>This License does not collectively grant any rights to corporations or groups of individuals when regarded as one legal entity. This License exclusively grants rights to private individuals.</p>

<h4><a name="lic-2-4">2.3</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators retain all other rights to their respective portions of the Internet Editions not covered by this License.

That parent or legal guardian is thereafter legally responsible to ensure that that child behaves in accordance with all of the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<p>The authority of a parent or legal guardian to distribute the Internet Editions does not extend to the distribution of the Internet Editions to any other person or persons except his or her child or legal dependent.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-3">3. Termination of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-3-0">3.0</a></h4>

<h3><a name="lic-4">4. Jurisdiction</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-4-0">4.0</a></h4>

<p>If, in consequence of court judgement or the laws of a particular area, any portion of the License is held as invalid or unenforceable in any particular circumstance, you are no longer granted any rights under the terms of this License in that circumstance. You agree to act in accordance with section 3.0 for all copies of the Internet Editions for which the License is held as invalid or unenforceable as if you had violated the terms and obligations of the License. The License is intended to remain in force in all other circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-5">5. Revision of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-5-0">5.0</a></h4>

<h3><a name="lic-6">6. NO WARRANTY</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-6-0">6.0</a></h4>

<p>BECAUSE THE INTERNET EDITIONS ARE LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE INTERNET EDITIONS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE INTERNET EDITIONS "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
