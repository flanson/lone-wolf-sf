<div class="frontmatter">

  <p>You are Lone Wolf—last of the Kai Lords. Bitter war rages through your homeland as the evil Darklords of the west lay siege to the capital.</p>

  <p>In <strong><cite>Fire on the Water</cite></strong>, the King has sent you on a desperate journey to retrieve the only power in Magnamund that can save your people: the Sommerswerd, the sword of the sun. Ahead of you lie terrible dangers—ferocious sea-storms, the tunnel of Tarnalin, and the ghostly death-hulks of Vonotar the Traitor. Use your skills wisely—for only you can save your land from the devastation of the Darklords.</p>

 
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


     <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.</p>

  <p>Gary was working as a children’s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain’s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>

  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>

  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model maker.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>In the northern land of Sommerlund, it has been the custom for many centuries to send the children of the Warrior Lords to the monastery of Kai. There they are taught the skills and disciplines of their noble fathers.</p>
<p>In olden times, during the Age of the Black Moon, the Darklords waged war on Sommerlund. The conflict was a long and bitter trial of strength that ended in victory for the Sommlending at the great battle of Maakengorge. King Ulnar and the allies of Durenor broke the Darklord armies at the pass of Moytura and forced them back into the bottomless abyss of Maakengorge. Vashna, mightiest of the Darklords, was slain upon the sword of King Ulnar, called ‘Sommerswerd’, the sword of the sun. Since that age, the Darklords have vowed vengeance upon Sommerlund and the House of Ulnar.</p>
<p>You are Lone Wolf, a young Kai initiate who was learning the secret skills of the Kai Lords. Two days ago, your peaceful country was plunged into war when a vast Darklord army suddenly invaded Sommerlund and completely destroyed the Kai Monastery. All the Kai Lords were in attendance for the feast of Fehmarn, and all were killed as the monastery was surrounded and destroyed, the walls collapsing in on the assembled company. You, the only Kai Lord to survive the massacre, vowed then to avenge their deaths. You knew your first task had to be to warn the King, for without the Kai Lords to lead her armies, your country, Sommerlund, would be unable to mobilize in time to drive the Darklords back.</p>
<p>Your journey to the capital was perilous indeed. The enemy had overrun much of the country and were marching upon Holmgard, the capital itself. But despite the many dangers, you fought your way through to the capital and delivered your warning to the King’s court. There you were greatly praised for your skill and bravery but told your mission was not complete: with the Kai Lords dead, there remained only one power in all of Magnamund that could save your people from the Darklords—the Sommerswerd.</p>
<p>After the defeat of Vashna, the Sommerswerd had been bestowed upon the allies of Durenor as a mark of trust and allegiance that exists between the two kingdoms. In return, King Alin of Durenor gave Sommerlund a magnificent golden ring bearing the royal arms of Durenor. This ring is known as the Seal of Hammerdal. At that time, King Alin vowed that if ever the shadow of the west should rise again to threaten Sommerlund, Durenor would come to the aid of her ally.</p>
<p>The King has given you the Seal of Hammerdal. Your quest is to travel to Durenor to fetch the Sommerswerd back. But meanwhile the enemy have broken through the outer defences to the capital and are preparing to besiege the city wall. As Captain D’Val of the King’s Guard leads you to the Royal Armoury to equip you for your mission, the King’s words keep coming back to you:</p>
<p>‘Forty days, Lone Wolf. We have strength to stand against them for only forty days.’</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on 4 in the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed Book 1 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you will already have your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, and <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#discplnz">Kai Disciplines</a> which you can now carry over with you to Book 2. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of Book 1 and these should be entered on your new <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>Through your experiences in <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/01fftd/title.htm#title">Book 1</a> you have learned new skills, and you may choose one extra <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#discplnz">Kai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>. Now read the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#equipmnt">section on equipment</a> for Book 2 carefully.</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Kai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are taught to all Kai Lords. You have learnt only five of the skills listed below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="camflage">Camouflage</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Kai Lord to blend in with his surroundings. In the countryside, he can hide undetected among trees and rocks and pass close to an enemy without being seen. In a town or city, it enables him to look and sound like a native of that area, and can help him to find shelter or a safe hiding place.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Camouflage’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hunting">Hunting</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Lord will never starve in the wild. He will always be able to hunt for food for himself except in areas of wasteland and desert. The skill also enables a Kai Lord to be able to move stealthily when stalking his prey.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Hunting: no need for a Meal when instructed to eat’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="sixthsns">Sixth Sense</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Lord of imminent danger. It may also reveal the true purpose of a stranger or strange object encountered in your adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Sixth Sense’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="tracking">Tracking</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to make the correct choice of a path in the wild, to discover the location of a person or object in a town or city and to read the secrets of footprints or tracks.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Tracking’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="healing">Healing</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline can be used to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in combat. If you possess this skill you may restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point to your total for every numbered section of the book you pass through in which you are not involved in combat. (This is only to be used after your <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) Remember that your <small>ENDURANCE</small> cannot rise above its original level.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill write ‘Healing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wepnskll">Weaponskill</a></h4>

<p>Upon entering the Kai Monastery, each initiate is taught to master one type of weapon. If Weaponskill is to be one of your Kai Disciplines, pick a number in the usual way from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>, and then find the corresponding weapon from the list below. This is the weapon in which you have skill. When you enter combat carrying this weapon, you add 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="278" width="386" src="./1_2_files/weapons.png"><br><br></div><p>The fact that you are skilled with a weapon does not mean you set out on the adventure carrying that particular weapon. However, you will have opportunities to acquire weapons in the course of your adventures. You cannot carry more than 2 weapons.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponskill in _______ +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points if this weapon carried’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindshld">Mindshield</a></h4>

<p>The Darklords and many of the evil creatures in their command have the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Kai Discipline of Mindshield prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindshield: no points lost when attacked by Mindblast’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mndblst">Mindblast</a></h4>

<p>This enables a Kai Lord to attack an enemy using the force of his mind. It can be used at the same time as normal combat weapons and adds two extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Not all the creatures encountered on this adventure will be harmed by Mindblast. You will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlknsp">Animal Kinship</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to communicate with some animals and to be able to guess the intentions of others.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Kinship’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindomtr">Mind Over Matter</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Discipline enables a Kai Lord to move small objects with his powers of concentration.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mind Over Matter’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 2 of <cite>Lone Wolf</cite>, you may add a further Kai Discipline of your choice to your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> in <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/03tcok/title.htm#title">Book 3</a>. This additional skill, together with your five or six other skills and any Special Items that you have picked up in Books 1 and 2, may then be used in the next adventure of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series which is called <cite><a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/03tcok/title.htm#title">The Caverns of Kalte</a></cite>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Guard Captain D’Val leads you to the Royal Armoury where your green tunic and Kai cloak are taken from you to be repaired and cleaned. While you await their return, Captain D’Val hands you a pouch of Gold for your journey. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>. Now add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you may enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>. (If you successfully completed <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/01fftd/title.htm#title">Book 1</a>, you may add this sum to the total of any Crowns you may already possess.)</p>
<p>On a large table in the centre of the armoury, a number of items have been laid out for your choice. You may take any two of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword (Weapons)<br><br>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="120" width="386" src="./1_2_files/sword.png"><br><br></div></li>

<h4><a name="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty crowns.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> is given capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill and the correct weapon, it adds 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember you can only carry two Weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry eight items in your Backpack at once.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Each Special Item has a particular purpose or effect. You may be told this when the item is discovered, or it may be revealed to you as the adventure progresses.<br><br>
Enter on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> a <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#map">map</a> that you found in the ashes of the Monastery.<br><br>
You begin this section with the Seal of Hammerdal, a ring that you wear on your right hand. Enter it on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> under Special Items.<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The local currency is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Gold Crowns can be used on your adventure to pay for transport, food, or even as a bribe! Many of the creatures that you will encounter possess Gold Crowns, or have them hidden in their lairs. Whenever you kill a creature, you may take any Gold Crowns that it has and put them in your Belt Pouch.<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Kai Discipline of Hunting as one of your five skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Healing Potion</dt>
<dd>This can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is only enough for one dose. If you discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be told then of their effect. All Healing Potions are Backpack Items.<br><br>
</dd>

<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.<br><br>
Example<br><br>
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast, to which the Winged Devil is not immune, so he adds 2 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 17.<br><br>
He subtracts the Winged Devil’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3. (17 − 20 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br><br>
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br><br>
Example<br><br>
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as −3. If the number taken from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
<li>Winged Devil loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br><br>
</li>
<li>On the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br><br>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Kai Training</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles that are bestowed upon Kai Lords at each stage of their training. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series, you will gain an additional Kai Discipline and gradually progress towards mastery of the ten basic Kai Disciplines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Novice</li>
<li>Intuite</li>
<li>Doan</li>
<li>Acolyte</li>
<li>Initiate—You begin the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures with this level of Kai training</li>
<li>Aspirant</li>
<li>Guardian</li>
<li>Warmarn or Journeyman</li>
<li>Savant</li>
<li>Master</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond the ten basic skills of the Kai Master await the secrets of the higher Kai Disciplines or ‘Magnakai’. By acquiring the wisdom of the Magnakai, a Kai Lord can progress towards the ultimate achievement and become a Kai Grand Master.</p>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Kai Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>Your mission will be one of great danger, for the Darklords and their servants are a cruel and fierce enemy who give and expect no mercy. Use the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#map">map</a> to help you steer a correct course for the capital. Make notes as you progress through the story, for they will be of great help in future adventures.</p>
<p>Many things that you find will aid you during the adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>There are many routes to Hammerdal, but only one will enable you to retrieve the Sommerswerd and return to Sommerlund with the minimum of danger. A wise choice of Kai Disciplines and a great deal of courage, will enable any player to complete the mission, no matter how weak their initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> or <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score.</p>

<p>Captain D’Val and his guards escort you to the citadel gate where a small covered wagon awaits you. As soon as you clamber in, the gates are thrown open and you are hurried away through the crowded streets of Holmgard. After a short but uncomfortable journey, the wagon stops and the driver pulls open the canvas flap.</p>
<p>‘This is the quay, my lord. There is your ship, the <cite>Green Sceptre</cite>.’ As he speaks the driver points across the quay to a sleek trade caravel anchored near to the harbour wall.</p>
<p>‘The first mate’s name is Ronan. You will find him waiting for you across the square at the Good Cheer Inn.’ Then the driver bids you farewell and quickly disappears into the teeming crowds.</p>
<p>You reach the inn to find the front doors locked and the window shutters barred. You are trying to decide what to do next when a hand grabs your arm and you are pulled into the darkness.</p>

<p>You are travelling along a narrow section of coast road which follows a dizzy course beneath high, overhanging cliffs. A rockfall has blocked the road ahead and you must stop to clear it. You are helping the driver to lever a large rock from the path of the carriage, when you hear the sound of falling rocks. A boulder crashes down from the overhanging cliff, killing the driver before you can make any attempt to save him. He was standing less than six feet away from you at the time of his death.</p>

<p>The tavern is full of brigands and drunks, the good-for-nothing crews of trading ships moored at the jetty, all singing and drinking while some try their strength at arm-wrestling. All are so engrossed that nobody notices you enter. In a far corner, you see the fishermen that robbed you. They are seated at a round table covered with empty ale tankards. You know that if you are to reach Durenor in time, you must retrieve the Seal of Hammerdal and your gold.</p>

<p>The door bursts open and in rushes a Helghast, its black sword raised. You strike the creature as it enters the hold and open a terrible gash in its chest. It lets out a hideous cry but although badly wounded, it leaps forward to attack you. You must fight this creature to the death.</p>

<p>The boy has spotted you following him. Once outside, he turns and runs south. You give chase but he has soon disappeared into the maze of alleyways and warehouses lining the waterfront.</p>

<p>It is early morning on the fifteenth day of your quest when you open your eyes to the breathtaking spectacle of Hammerdal, the mountain city. The capital of Durenor, unlike other cities in the Lastlands, does not need man-made fortifications. The encircling peaks of the Hammerdal Range offer a far more secure protection to the people within.</p>

<p>For three days and nights, the fleet of Durenor spread canvas and sail swiftly towards the Holmgulf. But although the voyage is fast, each ship in the fleet is cursed by misfortune. Sails tear, ropes mysteriously untie themselves and timbers warp and leak. The men become short-tempered in the cramped quarters, and fighting—often to the death—is commonplace. By the third night of the voyage, Lord Axim is close to despair.</p>
<p>‘Never have I suffered such a wretched journey. No enemy has been sighted nor battle fought, yet half my men are either ill or wounded, and we have lost two of our finest ships. We have been jinxed by an evil moon. How I pray that it would wane, for even if we were to arrive in Holmgard this very night I fear we are too weak to break the siege.’</p>
<p>As he speaks, you can see the dawn of the next day breaking. You think it may bring promise of relief, but the calm waters that now surround the fleet contain a far deadlier threat.</p>

<p>The power coursing through your body so overwhelms your senses that you become oblivious to your surroundings. You instinctively raise the blade above your head where a shaft of sunlight suddenly catches upon its very tip and floods the chamber with a blinding white glow. At that moment the true power of the Sommerswerd is revealed to you.</p>
<p>This weapon was forged long before the Sommlending, the Durenese, or the Darklords dwelt in the Lastlands. Its makers were of a race that men would now call gods. To release the power that it contains, only a Kai Lord may wield it. Should it be used in combat by anyone who is not a Kai Lord, its power will fade and be lost forever.</p>
<p>When used in combat, the Sommerswerd will add 8 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> (10 points if you possess the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill with swords). It has the ability to absorb any magic that is used against its bearer, and it doubles the total of all <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by undead enemies (e.g. Helghast) in combat. It is the only weapon in all of Magnamund that can kill a Darklord, and for this reason the Darklords are bent on thwarting your quest.</p>
<p>You now realize you hold the only power in Magnamund that can save your people. Slowly the light starts to fade and you become aware of Lord Axim’s hand upon your shoulder.</p>
<p>‘Come, Lone Wolf, there is much to prepare for your return to Sommerlund.’</p>
<p>You sheathe the Sommerswerd in its jewelled scabbard and follow Lord Axim as he leaves the King’s chamber.</p>
<p>Make the necessary adjustments to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total now that you possess the Sommerswerd.<sup><a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect79-1-foot" name="sect79-1">3</a></sup> Note the powers of the sword under the Special Items section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

The soldiers here have been involved in a desperate battle but have fought off the enemy and are cutting the grappling ropes that hold the ship to a death-hulk. From out of the smoke strides Lord Axim, his face bloodied and his shield badly scarred.</p>
<p>‘Thank the gods you are alive, Lone Wolf. The fight has been bitter and our losses are high, but I am heartened indeed to see you standing before me now,’ he says and leads you to the ship’s rail. ‘Look yonder, their flagship is ablaze.’</p>

The <cite>Kalkarm</cite> is eventually freed and slowly it manoeuvres out of the tangle of wreckage. A wind begins to stir, filling its tattered sails and carrying away the smoke of battle. Lord Axim orders the Royal Arms of Durenor to be hoist aloft so that other ships can rally to the <cite>Kalkarm</cite>. For the first time since the battle began, you can now see the other Durenese ships. It is an amazing sight for as the enemy flagship sinks beneath the waves, so every death-hulk on the horizon returns to its watery grave.</p>

<p>A large Noodnic, wearing a brightly coloured cloak of patchwork silks, orders several of his people to arm themselves and drive you out of the hall. When you speak to them in their own language, a hush of astonishment fills the cavern. Never before have they encountered a human being who could actually speak their tongue. For some of them it is too much to grasp, and they stare at you open-mouthed, their furry little arms hanging loosely by their sides.</p>
<p>Then the large Noodnic addresses you, saying he is the leader of this colony. His name is Gashgiss and he welcomes you and invites you to join him on top of a raised platform in the centre of the chamber.</p>

He looks at you nervously, and then asks, ‘Yooze notta Blackscreamerz, eh?’ You realize that the ‘Blackscreamerz’ that Gashgiss refers to are Helghast. You learn that two of them arrived in Tarnalin over two hours ago, and caused quite a panic in the main tunnel. Gashgiss knows where they are lying in ambush, waiting for you to appear.</p>

There is enough for two Meals. You thank her for her generosity and then follow Gashgiss along one of the many passages leading out of the cavern. After an hour of trekking through the dark, he stops and points towards a shaft of light that is pouring through a crevice in the far distance. ‘Yooze goez left, yooze be zafe,’ he says.</p>

Without a moment’s hesitation, you rise from the table and punch the sailor so hard in the face that he somersaults backwards crashing into his surprised friends. You leave them sprawled in a heap on the floor.</p>
<p>As you reach the tavern door, an ugly sailor draws his sword and blocks your escape. But before you have a chance to do anything, there is a loud thud and he falls to his knees. Behind him stands the serving girl, a large wooden club in her hand, smiling at you. You thank her, and wink as you race out of the door and into the darkened street beyond.</p>
<p>After running blindly in the dark for many minutes, you notice a stable and coach station through the gloom ahead. With the shouts of angry sailors still ringing in your ears, you run to the building and climb a ladder where you spend the night safely hidden in the hay-loft.</p>

<p>The voyage to Sommerlund is one of ill omen. Deep black storm clouds gather on the horizon, and a fierce wind relentlessly torments the restless sea. At night, great bolts of lightning tear open the darkness, followed by a rolling thunder so loud that it shakes every timber of the flagship. Many of the soldiers aboard the fleet are mountain-dwellers, unaccustomed to the shift of the sea. By the third day, over half their number are so ill as to be unable to stand. Lord Axim is close to despair.</p>
<p>‘How I pray that this storm will lift, for even if the fleet arrives intact, I fear our men will be too weak to break the enemy.’</p>
<p>Then, as if in answer to his prayer, the dawn of the next day heralds an end to the raging storms. But the calm waters now surrounding the fleet contain a danger far greater than any storm.</p>

<p>The guard stares at the magnificent ring in awe. The legend of the Seal of Hammerdal is well known to the people of Durenor. It is said that of all the lost treasures of the Durenese, the Seal of Hammerdal is one that they would not wish returned. The guard’s anxious face shows he clearly recognizes the ring’s dreadful significance.</p>
<p>‘I will not hinder your urgent mission, but I cannot help you except to set you on the road for Port Bax. Continue on this forest path and you will come to a fork near a stunted oak tree. Take the left track—it is the quickest way.’</p>
<p>You thank the loyal guard, and push on once more into the forest. A mile or so along the road, you come to the fork and take the left track. It leads to a stone bridge across the Rymerift.

<p>The following morning you are woken by the cry of seagulls as they wheel and soar above the clipper. The wind is strong and it fills the sails. You breakfast with Captain Kelman who is in better spirits than the previous day. He tells you that the <cite>Green Sceptre</cite> is making good speed and should arrive at Port Bax, the main Durenese seaport, within a week. Suddenly you hear a cry from the crow’s nest.</p>

<p>Captain Kelman hands you an ornate telescope with which to take a closer look. The sharp rocks are festooned with the splintered skeletons of ships that have run aground, or were dashed against the shore in a storm. You stare in fascination at the shattered hulls, imagining the terrifying scenes of their destruction. Then, suddenly, high above the pinnacles of stone hovers a black shadow, like a small rain cloud. It seems to be moving towards you. Suddenly you realize what the ‘cloud’ really is. It is a swarm of large Zlanbeast and possibly some Kraan. The alarm is shouted along the deck: ‘Prepare for battle!’</p>

<p>Seventy Durenese warships left Port Bax, but only fifty now enter the Holmgulf. The battle has claimed many brave men including Admiral Calfen, who died aboard the flagship <cite>Durenor</cite>, the first ship to be sunk. But despite the heavy loss, a great victory has been won, a victory which inspires the Durenese soldiers with new strength so that the past ordeal of both the voyage and the battle are now forgotten. As their optimism and determination return, all are eager to reach Holmgard and raise the siege.</p>

<br><br></div><p>Sitting opposite are two brothers named Ganon and Dorier. They are knights in the Order of the White Mountain, warrior lords of Durenor who have pledged allegiance to protect the country from raids by the bandits of the Wildlands. They own a castle and land near Port Bax. Next to them sits Halvorc the merchant. His nose is swollen and his face is badly bruised thanks to Lachlan, the Overlord of Ragadorn. A little misunderstanding about port taxes lost him his cargo and most of his gold. Seated by the far door is a priest called Parsion. Like you, he is a Sommlending who has journeyed across the Wildlands by coach on his way to Port Bax. Beside you sits a young woman called Viveka. She is a mercenary adventuress who earns her gold by fighting for it, and sells her services to the highest bidder. She is returning to Port Bax having collected payment for a successful adventure in Ragadorn.</p>
<p>Not wishing to reveal your true identity, you have pretended to be a simple peasant. The travellers seem unaware of the war that now rages in Sommerlund.</p>

<p>A sailor called Sprogg sits beside you and explains the rules of the game ‘Portholes’. First he shows you two diamond-shaped dice made of red glass. Each die has ten sides and they are numbered 0–9. Each player rolls both dice and adds the numbers together (0 = zero). If anyone throws two 0s, they shout ‘portholes’ and automatically win.</p>
<p>Each player stakes 3 Gold Crowns per throw. There are two other players in the game and they all place their stake money into a hat before the dice are rolled.</p>
<p>Pick two numbers from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> for each of the other two players, and note these scores down.

The bolt of energy disappears into the golden blade like water into a drain. (You remember that the Sommerswerd has the power to absorb magic. This power has saved you from certain death.)</p>
<p>The sorcerer curses you, pulls a jewel from his ornate tokmor, and throws it at your feet. There is a flash of flame and a cloud of choking green gas billows up in your face, filling your nostrils with its acidic smell. You are forced to jump to the deck below to avoid the poisonous gas, and you just catch a glimpse of the sorcerer as he frantically paddles a small boat away from the death-hulk flagship.</p>

<p>Holmgard has suffered much since your departure. Many of the shops and houses you remember passing on your way to the quay, are little more now than heaps of ashes. The Darklords’ army with their evil engines of war surround the walls, and the flaming arcs of fireballs shooting through the air continually light the night sky as they rain down on the streets below. The people fight the fire as best they can, but they are hungry and exhausted and close to surrender. At first, as it enters the harbour, the fleet is mistaken for the enemy and cries of despair can be heard all along the quay. But as the first of the soldiers set foot in the city and unfurl the royal arms of Durenor, the news of your return spreads quickly. The cries of despair have changed to a chorus of cheers: ‘The Kai Lord has returned.’</p>
<p>You are standing at the top of the great watchtower, high above the main gate of the city, when the first light of dawn creeps slowly over the horizon. Thousand upon thousand of the black-clad enemy are massed around the city wall, huddled like beetles in the trenches that cover the plain. In the midst of this horde, a great red tent has been erected bearing the symbol of a broken skull. It is the mark of Zagarna, Lord of Kaag, a Darklord of Helgedad. His great ambition is the destruction of Holmgard; his fiercest desire to lead his army to victory over the House of Ulnar and claim Sommerlund for his own.</p>
<p>But victory is not to be his this day. Raising the Sommerswerd high above your head, a shaft of dawn sunlight catches upon the tip of the golden sword and a brilliant flash of blinding white flame runs the entire length of the blade. The power of the Sommerswerd electrifies you. Your senses reel and now your body reacts instinctively. You lower the Sommerswerd and point the blade towards the tent of Lord Zagarna. There is a mighty roar as the power of the sun-sword is unleashed in a searing white beam. The tent explodes and a brilliant fireball of white flame mushrooms skyward. A long and terrible cry rends the air. It is Lord Zagarna. The leader of the evil army is no more.</p>

Again the Sommerswerd has returned to defeat them. The army and the allies of Durenor ride out of the city gates in pursuit of the panic-stricken enemy as they run blindly towards the Durncrag Mountains. The victory is yours.

<p>(<a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect283">283</a>) Replaced ‘above Items’ with ‘above items’.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect284">284</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption. Added ‘(You do not need to adjust your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.)’.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect287">287</a>) Replaced ‘click’ with ‘<i>click</i>’.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect289">289</a>) Replaced ‘Jala’ with ‘jala’. Replaced ‘seal’ with ‘Seal’.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect296">297</a>) Replaced ‘door, and’ with ‘door and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect298">298</a>) Replaced ‘If you do not have a Weapon, you’ with ‘You’ since Lone Wolf has had no opportunity to acquire Weapons.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect299">Section 299</a>) The original edition of this book reads: ‘If you wish to give him your Magic Spear, so that he can defend the tunnel entrance, <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect102">turn to 102</a>. If you do not possess a Magic Spear, or do not wish to give it to Rhygar, <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect118">turn to 118</a>.’ Later editions came out reversing these two choices (i.e. the first choice leads to <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect118">Section 118</a>, the second choice to <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect102">Section 102</a>). Both of these versions are very problematic to game flow and inspired a controversy among the members of Project Aon. The version that you see in our text is a mixed scenario intended to most closely match the author’s surmised original intention, even though it does not appear in either previously published version.</p>
<p>If you wish to use either of the previously published versions, then refer to the appropriate choice as listed here. Discussion of the different versions follows:</p>
<p>Original version: The choices appear to serve no other purpose other than punishing Lone Wolf with certain death for mercifully handing Rhygar the Spear. The fact that this version was revised and the path that Lone Wolf is given in the <cite>Legends of Lone Wolf</cite> series also both appear to refute the correctness of this version.</p>
<p>Revised version: Under this version, it is impossible for Lone Wolf to succeed without taking the left path back at the beginning of the Durenor Forest (<a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#sect150">Section 150</a>), ignoring the warning of the Szalls, and fighting the Helghast. This directly contradicts the statement in <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/02fotw/title.htm#kaiwisdm">Kai Wisdom</a> that a wise choice of Disciplines enables you to succeed regardless of your starting <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> scores.</p>
<p>Project Aon version: Although never previously published, this scenario allows Lone Wolf to succeed despite giving the Magic Spear to Rhygar.</p>
