<div class="frontmatter">

  <p>You are Lone Wolf—last of the Kai Lords. To the south of your homeland of Sommerlund lies the rich but remote mining province of Ruanon. When a regular shipment of gold suddenly vanishes, the King dispatches a patrol of his best cavalry to investigate the suspected theft. They do not return.</p>

  <p>In <strong><cite>The Chasm of Doom</cite></strong>, you are sent to recover the missing gold and locate the lost patrol, but you soon discover that it is a mission of direful consequence—for the fate of your country is at stake!</p>

 
     <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>


    <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.</p>

  <p>Gary was working as a children’s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain’s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>

  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>

  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model maker.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>Ruanon is a remote mining province to the south of your homeland, Sommerlund. Nestling between the sullen peaks of the Durncrag and Maaken mountains, the people of this province have long prospered from their toil in the ore-rich mines, living and enjoying their wealth under the protection of their lord—Baron Vanalund.</p>
<p>The gold and gems that are mined at Ruanon yield an important source of revenue to your homeland. The heavily guarded convoy of wagons that leave the province and journey to the capital has become a regular monthly routine; a routine that had never been broken until one month ago when, suddenly, all contact with Ruanon ceased. A troop of one hundred cavalry from the King’s Guard were immediately dispatched to investigate the whereabouts of the missing convoy. Their commanding officer, Captain D’Val, was ordered to report back to the King as soon as contact was made, but he and his men have not returned: they too have disappeared without trace.</p>
<p>The King has summoned you, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords, to his citadel at Holmgard. Your quest is to find Captain D’Val and his men, discover what has happened to the missing convoy, and to uncover the veil of mystery that now hangs over Ruanon. The King has gathered a company of Border Rangers, a unit of élite scouts, all of whom are skilled in horsemanship and outdoor survival. He has ordered these fifty men to accompany you in the hope that, with your leadership, they may succeed where the larger and more visible force failed.</p>
<p>As you and your men enter the Royal Armoury to equip yourselves for the long ride ahead, you glimpse a black crow perched on a window ledge high above. It flies away, but not before a shiver has run down your spine: in Holmgard, the crow is a bird of ill omen.</p>

<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
<p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you will already have your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, and Kai Disciplines which you can now carry over with you to Book 4. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
<p>You may choose one bonus <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#discplnz">Kai Discipline</a> to add to your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure you have successfully completed; then read the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#equipmnt">section on equipment</a> for Book 4 carefully.</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Kai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are taught to all Kai Lords. You are a Kai initiate which means that you have learnt only five of the skills listed below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="camflage"> Camouflage</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Kai Lord to blend in with his surroundings. In the countryside, he can hide undetected among trees and rocks and pass close to an enemy without being seen. In a town or city, it enables him to look and sound like a native of that area, and can help him to find shelter or a safe hiding place.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Camouflage’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hunting">Hunting</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Lord will never starve in the wild. He will always be able to hunt for food for himself except in areas of wasteland and desert. You are aware that the Wildlands south of the Pass of Moytura are a wasteland and that opportunities for successful hunting may not arise until you reach the Ruanon Forest. But this skill is still very useful for it also enables a Kai Lord to move with great speed and dexterity.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Hunting’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="sixthsns">Sixth Sense</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Lord of imminent danger. It may also reveal the true purpose of a stranger or strange object encountered in your adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Sixth Sense’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="tracking">Tracking</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to make the correct choice of a path in the wild, to discover the location of a person or object in a town or city and to read the secrets of footprints or tracks.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Tracking’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="healing">Healing</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline can be used to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in combat. If you possess this skill, you may restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point to your total for every numbered section of the book you pass through in which you are not involved in combat. (This is only to be used after your <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) Remember that your <small>ENDURANCE</small> cannot rise above its original level.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Healing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wepnskll">Weaponskill</a></h4>

<p>Upon entering the Kai Monastery, each initiate was taught to master one type of weapon. If Weaponskill is to be one of your Kai Disciplines, pick a number in the usual way from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>, and then find the corresponding weapon from the list below. This is the weapon in which you have skill. When you enter combat carrying this weapon, you add 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="278" width="386" src="./1_4_files/weapons.png"><br><br></div><p>The fact that you are skilled with a weapon does not mean that you set out on this adventure carrying it, but you will have opportunities to acquire weapons in the course of your adventure. You cannot carry more than 2 weapons.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponskill in _______ +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points if this weapon carried’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindshld">Mindshield</a></h4>

<p>Some of the hostile creatures of Magnamund have the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Kai Discipline of Mindshield prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindshield: no points lost when attacked by Mindblast’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mndblast">Mindblast</a></h4>

<p>This enables a Kai Lord to attack an enemy using the force of his mind. It can be used at the same time as normal combat weapons and adds two extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Not all the creatures encountered on this adventure will be harmed by Mindblast. You will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlknsp">Animal Kinship</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to communicate with some animals and to be able to guess the intentions of others.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Kinship’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindomtr">Mind Over Matter</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Discipline enables a Kai Lord to move small objects with his powers of concentration.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mind Over Matter’ on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 4 of <cite>Lone Wolf</cite>, you may add a further Kai Discipline of your choice to your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> in <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#title">Book 5</a>. This additional skill, together with your other skills and any Special Items that you have found, may then be used in the next adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series which is called <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/05sots/title.htm#title"><cite>Shadow on the Sand</cite></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>Before leaving Holmgard on your ride south, you are given a <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#map">Map of the Southlands</a>, a Badge of Rank that you wear upon the sleeve of your tunic, and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>. Now add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you may now enter this number in the ‘Gold Crowns’ section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>. (If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total of any Crowns you may already possess. Remember you can only carry a maximum of fifty Crowns.)</p>
<p>You may take your pick of the following items (in addition to those you already possess, but remember you may only carry two weapons). You may take up to six of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer (Weapons)<br><br>

<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>

<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill and the correct weapon, it adds 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember you can only carry two weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at any time.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Each Special Item has a particular purpose or effect. You may be told this when the item is discovered, or it may be revealed to you as the adventure progresses.</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The currency of Sommerlund is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Whenever you kill an enemy and search the body, you may take any Gold Crowns that you find and put them in your Belt Pouch.</dd>
<dt><a name="food">Food</a></dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If you have chosen the Kai Discipline of Hunting as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat (unless you are in an area of wilderness where the opportunity for hunting is limited).</dd>
<dt>Potions of Laumspur</dt>
<dd>These are healing potions that can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for two doses only. If you discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be informed of their effect. All potions are Backpack Items.</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.<br><br>
Example<br><br>
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast to which the Winged Devil is not immune, so he adds 2 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 17.<br><br>
He subtracts the Winged Devil’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3. (17 − 20 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br><br>
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br><br>
Example<br><br>
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as 3. If the number taken from the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
<li>Winged Devil loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br><br>
</li>
<li>On the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br><br>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Kai Training</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles that are bestowed upon Kai Lords at each stage of their training. As you successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series, you will gain an additional Kai Discipline and gradually progress towards mastery of the ten basic Kai Disciplines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Novice</li>
<li>Intuite</li>
<li>Doan</li>
<li>Acolyte</li>
<li>Initiate—You begin the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures with this level of Kai training</li>
<li>Aspirant</li>
<li>Guardian</li>
<li>Warmarn or Journeyman</li>
<li>Savant</li>
<li>Master</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond the ten basic skills of the Kai Master await the secrets of the higher Kai Disciplines or ‘Magnakai’. By acquiring the wisdom of the Magnakai, a Kai Lord can progress towards the ultimate achievement and become a Kai Grand Master.</p>

<p>Your mission will be fraught with danger, for you are about to venture into the bleak and hostile Wildlands of the south. Use the <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#map">map</a> to help you plot your course to Ruanon. Make notes as you progress through the story, for they will be of great help in future adventures.</p>
<p>Many things that you find will aid you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>There are several routes to Ruanon, but only one will enable you to reach the mining town and find Captain D’Val with the minimum of danger. A wise choice of Kai Disciplines and a great deal of courage should enable any player to complete the mission, no matter how weak his initial <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points score. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures is not essential for the success of this quest.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>For three days you lead your brave company of rangers across the lush plains of southern Sommerlund on the first stage of your urgent mission. The flat, treeless fields surround you with a seemingly endless expanse of wheat, so high that even though you are in the saddle it reaches well above your knees. Your horses seem to be swimming through a vast yellow sea of corn that is only interrupted by an occasional track, or group of isolated farmhouses.</p>
<p>The southerners welcome your sudden appearance, but you only make the briefest stops for food and rest, neither wishing to risk becoming a burden, nor alarm these good people with your mission.</p>
<p>By noon on the fourth day, you reach the Pass of Moytura. Here the plains give way to the broken foothills of the Durncrag Mountains. You soon reach a highway, the surface cracked and full of pot-holes, heading off towards the south. This is the notorious Ruanon Pike. South of the pass, the Ruanon Pike crosses a hundred miles of open territory known as ‘Raider’s Road’. Bandit tribes from the Wildlands and Giak war-bands from the mountains of the west frequently ambush those who travel along the Pike, and the regular shipment of gold and gems from the mines at Ruanon have sometimes yielded rich pickings to these merciless robbers.</p>
<p>‘Point and flankers,’ you shout, and immediately three groups of rangers peel away from the column and spur their horses to a gallop. You watch with pride as the expert horsemen take up their scouting positions to the front and side of the company.</p>
<p>It is late afternoon when a ranger scout approaches the company from the west. He points towards a craggy outcrop where a thin spiral of wood smoke betrays a hut hidden beneath the overhanging rock.</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="[illustration]" border="0" align="middle" height="150" width="386" src="./1_4_files/small1.png"><br><br></div><p class="choice">If you wish to investigate the hut, <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#sect160">turn to 160</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>You search the bodies of the dead bandits and discover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword</li>
<li>Mace</li>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Warhammer</li>
<li>12 Gold Crowns</li>
<li>Backpack</li>
<li>Enough food for 2 Meals</li>

<p>You may take any of the above items but be sure to mark them on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>Picking up the map that lies on the bloodstained table, you notice that the room in which you now stand has been surrounded by a circle of black ink. The map reveals that a door in the far wall opens on to a passageway leading directly to the surface. Eager to leave the death-filled chamber, you pass through the door and run steadily along the passageway towards a distant shaft of sunlight. It takes several seconds for your eyes to adjust to the glare of the sun, but gradually you realize that you have finally escaped from the Maaken Mines and are in the western foothills less than two miles from Ruanon itself.</p>
<p>However, several bandit warriors can be seen patrolling an entrance to the mines, just below the rocky ledge on which you now crouch. If you are to reach Ruanon alive, you must avoid these patrols at all costs.</p>
<p>Waiting until the enemy patrols have disappeared from view, you make your way down a steep track leading into a copse of densely packed trees. A brief pause for breath is all that you allow yourself before setting off through the forest towards Ruanon.</p>

<p>You climb the barricade and shout the order: ‘Draw bows!’ And, as the enemy shield-wall closes fast in a deadly race to beat your archers, ‘Fire!’</p>
<p>Their shields of cured skin and wood are no defence against the hail of death that tears into their ranks. The whole line seems to pause and sway; great gaps appear and spearmen fall in heaps on the field. Few escape being injured.</p>
<p>You sense a turn in the tide of battle. The enemy are pulling away from the barricades by the score, carrying their wounded on their backs and on their upturned shields.</p>
<p>You jump from the wall and race back towards the watchtower where Captain D’Val is still embroiled in a bitter struggle against the bandit horsemen. You are about to leap over the body of a dead bandit warrior when he suddenly comes to life and lashes out at your legs with a mace. He was only feigning death and his surprise attack has knocked you to the ground. You lose 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point.</p>

<p>You recognize the fungi to be Calacena. The spores of these pink mushrooms are much sought after by illusionists and magicians, although it is said that they can cause terrible hallucinations and even madness. As you step gingerly along the corridor, you take great care not to tread or brush against the spore-laden fungi.</p>
<p>The tunnel continues uninterrupted for several miles before eventually reaching a long, deserted gallery.</p>

<p>You push him to the ground and smother him with your Kai cloak. The flames are soon extinguished and you draw away your cloak to see how badly he is injured. Your quick action has saved the captain’s life for although his uniform is burnt and tattered, he has survived the fire unscathed.</p>
<p>‘It is my turn to thank you, Lone Wolf. This time it is you who has saved me from certain death.’</p>
<p>You help the captain to his feet and race to the barricade; the enemy have now reached the ruined perimeter of Ruanon, and they are creeping forward under cover of the broken cottage walls. Climbing up onto an overturned wagon, you order the Sommlending guards back to the barricades. But is it too late to repel the attack?</p>

<p>Your enemy falls from the saddle, and his body is dragged away by his horse, a twisted foot ensnared in the stirrup. All around you the din of battle rages. You realize that these armour-clad horsemen are no ordinary bandit clan; they fight with a discipline and skill unheard of among the lowly outlaws of the Wildlands.</p>
<p>A horse passes close by, the dead body of a ranger still upright in the saddle. You snatch the reins and retrieve a war-horn from the dead man’s neck. If you are to avoid total disaster, you know that you must quickly sound the retreat.</p>

<p>Your men secure the boat to a rusty iron ring before following you up the stone steps towards the archway.

<p>Your rangers spread out and move stealthily forward under cover of the large boulders. When you are almost close enough to reach out and touch the enemy, you give a piercing whistle—the signal to attack! In unison, your men rise up and strike. Two bandits die instantly, their skulls cloven in two by ranger swords. A third turns to run, but he is felled from behind and swept away in the foam-flecked water. Your target is a formidable looking warrior; great bracers of steel encase his wrists and a grim necklace of shrunken skulls adorns his leather battle-jerkin. You strike first, but his reactions are lightning-fast. He turns your blow aside with his spear and lunges at your face.</p>

<p>An arrow hisses overhead; a scream of agony fills the air. The bow slips from the archer’s fingers as he sinks to his knees, the arrow lodged deep between his startled eyes. The clack of fangs and the soft swift pad of stealthy feet tell you that the Warhounds are closing in. You look up to see a man running towards you from the barricade. He has a shield in one hand and a longbow in the other; it is Guard Captain D’Val. He reaches you, breathless from his run, and draws an arrow from his quiver. D’Val aims and fires, drawing another arrow from his quiver as soon as the first is loosed. The Warhounds tumble and crash to the ground around you, felled by D’Val’s deadly shafts. Eight lie dead before his quiver is empty.</p>

<p>‘You must save her, Lone Wolf. You must prevent the sacrifice!’ The Baron’s voice is choked with emotion.</p>
<p>‘Save who? Who must he save?’ questions Captain D’Val, as he tries to calm the excited Baron.</p>
<p>‘My daughter, Madelon, of course,’ the Baron answers. Tears are welling up in his eyes and nervously he wrings his hands. Then he utters the ominous prophecy:</p>
<blockquote class="poetry"><p>
When the full moon shines o’er the temple deep,<br>A sacrifice will stir from sleep<br>The legions of a long forgotten lord.<br>When a fair royal maid on the altar dies,<br>The dead of Maakengorge shall rise<br>To claim their long-awaited reward.

<p>Captain D’Val ushers you from the chamber and closes the door. ‘I feared he was insane, and I refused to listen to his words. But the events of the last few days confirm my worst nightmare. He speaks the truth!’</p>
<p>As the dreadful significance of the prophetic verse begins to chill your spine, your thoughts are broken by the shrill blast of a war-horn. Captain D’Val strides over to an arrow slit in the wall and looks out across the desolate plain. As he turns to speak, his face is ashen grey. ‘The bandits—they’re launching an attack!’</p>

<p>As you approach they slip back their hoods to reveal two smiling faces. They seem relieved to have made friendly contact in the middle of this inhospitable wasteland. Neither of them speaks, but they remove amulets from around their necks and offer them as some kind of identification. The small wooden fish hanging on the neck-chains are symbols of a Holy Order known as ‘The Redeemers’, a silent order of pilgrims devoted to a lifetime of prayer and the study of the healing arts.</p>

<p>Struggling to your feet, you stagger along the forest track as it ascends into the darkening foothills of the Maaken Range. The track comes to an abrupt end at the entrance of a mine tunnel, partially obscured by foliage. You realize this must be a disused route into the Maaken Mines, for they honeycomb the foothills and mountains of this region. You know that if you can locate one of the major shafts, you should be able to trace your way through the mines to Ruanon itself.</p>
<p>Just inside the tunnel entrance, you find a broken crate containing five Torches and a Tinderbox. The tunnel is pitch black and you will need at least one torch to light your way. You may take as many additional Torches as you wish before continuing, but each Torch takes up one space in your Backpack.<sup><a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#sect79-1-foot" name="sect79-1">4</a></sup></p>

The flicker of a log fire is all that illuminates this foul-smelling hovel, yet it sheds enough light for you to see the clutter of charts and strange instruments that crowd the hut.

<p>‘You know my name—how?’ you ask warily.</p>
<p>‘The stars foretold our meeting long ago, Lone Wolf,’ he replies, slowly passing his withered old hands around the sphere. ‘Be not alarmed by my knowledge for I wish only to aid you.’ He produces a small scroll of parchment from within his robe, and he hands it to you.

<blockquote class="poetry"><p>
When the full moon shines o’er the temple deep,<br>A sacrifice will stir from sleep<br>The legions of a long forgotten lord.<br>When a fair royal maid on the altar dies,<br>The dead of Maakengorge shall rise<br>To claim their long-awaited reward.

<p>‘I was hoping the King would send a large search party,’ says Captain D’Val wryly, now having fully recovered from his exhaustion. ‘I was beginning to tire of this town.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, the bandits—Barraka’s men,’ retorts D’Val, his gruff voice conveying his contempt for them and their leader. ‘It seems we have both suffered at his hand. A month ago, he and his Vassagonian renegades ambushed my troop on the Ruanon Pike. We were sorely outnumbered and the fight was indeed bitter. But we broke free from them and escaped here to Ruanon. We have been beleaguered ever since and praying for help to arrive. We have enough weapons to resist them, but we have barely enough food and water to survive.’</p>
<p>You ask what has become of the people of Ruanon. ‘Most are now slaves. Barraka has taken the mines and he uses the Ruanese as forced labour. Other than yourself, only one man has escaped from the mines and survived the Warhounds and the bandit snipers. That man is Baron Oren Vanalund. Come, I shall take you to him.’</p>

Dropping onto the stable roof, you discover to your dismay that the clay tiles are wafer-thin and splinter beneath your weight; you crash straight through the flimsy roof into the hay below.

Astride the creature sits a warrior wreathed in iron and steel, the scimitar in his hand stained with Sommlending blood. He swings one leg from his gem-encrusted saddle, pauses, and then leaps down to the watchtower roof. A voice echoes in your head as the warrior closes in.</p>
<p>‘Say your prayers, Sommlending, for your life is soon to end!’</p>

Your face is streaked with sweat, and your lungs feel as though they will burst, but you dare not slacken your pace; the thought of Warhound fangs closing and tugging on your skin is all you need to drive you forward.</p>

At three hundred yards, you run into some gruesome remains, where the corpses of bandits lie twisted on the ground, most killed by arrows. Many have lain in the open for weeks; a flock of startled carrion crows rise shrieking from their feast as you race through the bodies. You turn away in disgust.</p>

You order your men to go on ahead while you secure the door. It takes a great effort to force the lock closed. You hear the hollow <i>click</i> of the lock, but this is echoed by a click far louder. A trap has been sprung. The floor opens in the centre of the passage and swallows all your men, screaming with terror, into the void below. With fear rising in your throat, you race to the edge and peer into the inky black pit. The walls are sheer and its depth unknown. A cold breeze on your face and the eerie sound of wind whistling through the chasm is all that meets your desperate stare. With heavy heart, you bid a silent farewell to your lost men and hurry towards the distant door.</p>

There is an explosion of searing white flame. The heat scorches your face, and you are thrown to the floor. You lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<p>You stare in horror as Barraka, his arm torn from his body by the blast, staggers backwards across the temple. He has been blinded by the fire, and he claws at his sightless eyes with his remaining hand. You watch in silence as he stumbles through the black skull doors and plummets into Maakengorge, swallowed up by the Chasm of Doom.</p>

Then each man is forced to take hold of a wagon and push it back along the tunnel. Soon they have all disappeared from view.</p>
<p>You wait, and when you are sure that the coast is clear you step back into the tunnel and press on, taking care to keep well in the shadows. You finally reach a point where the tunnel emerges into daylight. To your left, a dense copse has been cut back from the entrance, and wagon tracks lead to a timber gantry above a mound of ore. The men and the guards who passed you are now at the gantry, but they fail to see you sprint from the entrance and dive into the trees. A brief pause for breath is all you allow yourself before setting off through the trees towards Ruanon.</p>

Cavalry are pouring onto the plain from all sides, grouping up into battalions in preparation for the advance. Columns of foot soldiers in bright scarlet armour march through their ranks, herding a frightened wall of people before them.</p>
<p>‘They’re Ruanese!’ cries D’Val, his hand shielding the light from his eyes. ‘That cur Barraka; he’s using them as a shield!’</p>
<p>All around you, the captain’s men have drawn their bowstrings, awaiting his signal to fire. But it is an order he dare not give. Suddenly a hidden catapult hurls a massive black rock through the air, straight towards the barricade. You stare in horror as it bursts into flame and disintegrates, showering a rain of blazing oil on everyone beneath. The soldiers cannot evade the deluge, and many are badly burnt before the flames are smothered. A battle-cry resounds from the enemy ranks: the signal to attack. The Ruanese are pushed aside and trampled by the onrush of scarlet warriors who now race towards the barricade.</p>

As they flood out from the trees, the bandit warriors discard their bows in favour of long, curved swords. Many of them stumble and fall, but their leader beats them forward with the flat of his battle-axe. He is an ugly brute dressed in a heavy brass hauberk. As the first of the enemy smash into the shield-wall, he screams a deafening war-cry. A numbing thunder of blows rains down as the bandits hew and slice into your line.

Their swords slice into the evil Warhounds until both dogs stiffen and die, and you thankfully stagger to your feet and try to assess the situation as the battle rages all around. Sommlending soldiers still man the barricade, forming in groups that hold firm where the wall does not. Spears and arrows arc through the sky piercing metal, wood, and flesh. Men fall from their horses, horses scream and bolt, and the dead and the wounded lie everywhere.</p>
<p>The Warhounds have been driven back upon the spears of their masters, who now advance behind a wall of shields.

<p>A circle of unshaven faces are staring down at you. A soldier cradles your leg as another snaps the shaft buried deeply in your thigh. But before you can even cry out in pain, he has drawn the arrow from your leg with one swift tug. ‘You are very lucky, Kai Lord,’ he says, as he bandages a handful of Laumspur to your aching limb. ‘The wound is clean, and the bleeding is but slight.’</p>
<p>You lose 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points, but the soldier’s quick thinking and skill has saved your leg from infection. With great care the soldiers carry both you and Captain D’Val into the stone watchtower.</p>

<p>You plummet head-first into the darkness, the wind screaming past your face. Gritting your teeth, you try not to think of that terrible moment of impact, when you will smash into the hard, unyielding rock. But instead of a stone floor, you hit the surface of an underground river and plunge far down into its icy cold depths. You are so relieved to be alive that you momentarily forget where you are and inhale. As water enters your lungs, you fight to control the pain that now wracks your chest. You quickly become aware that your Backpack is dragging you down. You must discard it, or you will surely drown. When you eventually reach the surface, you claw your way out of the icy water and collapse on a gravel bank, coughing and gasping for air.</p>
<p>You have lost your Backpack and everything that it contained, but you are still alive and relatively unharmed.</p>

<p>You are halfway across the underground river when the inky black water begins to seethe and boil. You cling to the gunwale and urge your men to row for all they are worth, for the turbulent water now threatens to capsize your crowded little boat. Suddenly a hideous greyish green tentacle breaks through the surface. Like a whiplash it crashes down, splintering wood and cracking bone as it coils around two of your men. Before you can even draw your weapon, they have been dragged down into the bubbling depths. Then another tentacle rises, snaking towards you. It stabs at your chest and tries to butt you overboard.</p>

<p>Your blow has splintered the horseman’s lance. As he reins his horse about, he discards his broken weapon and draws a curved broadsword. His smile is evil, exposing a jagged line of blackened teeth. He spits a battle-cry and spurs his horse towards you once more.</p>

<p>You search the stalls to discover that only eleven horses remain; the others have been stolen by the bandits. After careful thought, you decide to call for ten volunteers to continue the mission with you, and order the remaining rangers to return to Sommerlund on foot at first light to report what has happened. As they head off to the north at dawn, you wait until they have vanished from sight before you turn and ride in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>For over five minutes you climb the spiral staircase before reaching the next level, where a mine tunnel leads off towards the south. You have covered less than a hundred yards of the dank passage when you discover a lever, set high up on the left-hand wall. A sudden noise in the distance betrays a guard patrol marching towards you. Without a second thought you pull the lever and a stone panel slides back to reveal a secret tunnel. You enter quickly to avoid the guards. Once they have passed by, you try to leave but find that you cannot re-open the stone panel from the inside. With a growing feeling of despair, you turn and follow the secret tunnel.</p>

<p>You are at the bottom of the cellar ladder when the trapdoor slams shut and you hear a bolt slide across and lock. You hammer on the trapdoor desperately trying to escape, but your captors cover the trapdoor with a heavy oak cask and keep guard in the room above. Four days pass before the lock slides back, but the hands that open the trapdoor are bony and fleshless.</p>

<p>Less than fifty yards along the tunnel wall you notice a lever. Your Kai instincts make you naturally suspicious of this unusual feature, and you scour the floor looking for evidence of a trap. You find nothing, but a glance at the roof reveals the underside of a wide portcullis hidden between two beams.</p>
<p>You pull the lever and the portcullis falls, sealing off the tunnel behind you. To make sure you will not be followed, you smash the lever with a wedge of stone before continuing along the tunnel.</p>

<p>Judging by the smoothness of the stone floor and the condition of the ore wagons, you deduce that this gallery must service a major section of the mines. A fresh breeze can be felt blowing out of the west tunnel, and you sense that you must be near the surface.</p>
<p>Ruanon lies due west, the same direction as the ore wagon tunnel. You take a deep breath and emerge from the shadows, cross the gallery, and quietly enter the archway beyond.</p>

<p>As Barraka dies, the wind suddenly rises in pitch and intensity, filling the temple with a mournful cry of despair. You feel the chill, malevolent spirit of Darklord Vashna engulfing you in an icy embrace, but you sense that he is powerless to harm you. The sacrifice has been foiled; he is doomed to lament for a victory that might have been.</p>
<p>Lying on the black temple floor is the Dagger of Vashna. As you pick it up and tuck it into your belt (mark this on your <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-less-simple/lw/04tcod/title.htm#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item), the evil blue flame flickers and dies. As long as you possess this evil blade, Darklord Vashna and his legion of dead warriors will remain imprisoned in the Chasm of Doom.</p>
<p>You free fair Madelon from the altar and carry her through the corridors of the temple that lead up to the surface. As you emerge into the moonlit ruins, an astounding sight greets your eyes. Barraka’s warriors are running from the ghost city in all directions, closely pursued by an army of cavalrymen. The light of the full moon and the guttering torches that these horsemen carry, illuminates the sun-crest that bedecks their tunics. Word must have reached Holmgard for they are the Sommlending army, led by King Ulnar himself. Your countrymen praise your courage and daring, their strident cheers drowning the cry of Maakengorge, for once again you have proved yourself a true hero of Sommerlund. As you deliver Madelon into the waiting arms of her father, his overwhelming joy fills you with a sense of great achievement. You are indeed worthy of the title ‘Kai Lord’. You have succeeded in your perilous quest, but the epic saga of Lone Wolf—last of the Kai Lords—is far from complete. A new and deadly challenge awaits you in Book 5 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series entitled:</p>

<h3><a name="lic-2">2. Terms of Distribution</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-2-0">2.0</a></h4>

<h4><a name="lic-2-1">2.1</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators grant you the right to receive a copy or copies of the Internet Editions from the Distribution Point at no charge provided that you agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License. If you do not agree to all of the terms and obligations of this License, you are not granted any rights by this License.</p>
<p>You agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License by the act of receiving or viewing a copy of any portion of the Internet Editions even though you have not signed a written document. Indeed, you have no right to receive or view a copy or copies without first accepting this License as legally valid and binding and agreeing to the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-2">2.2</a></h4>

<p>You agree to refrain from redistributing a significant portion of the Internet Editions in any form, electronic or otherwise, to any other person or persons for any reason by any means. You are granted the right to receive a copy or copies only for your own personal use.</p>
<p>This License does not collectively grant any rights to corporations or groups of individuals when regarded as one legal entity. This License exclusively grants rights to private individuals.</p>
<p>Redistribution includes but is not limited to displaying the Internet Editions within the graphical representation of an Internet site other than the Distribution Point. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the use of HTML ‘frames’.</p>
<p>An exception to the restrictions on redistribution in this section is made in that you may send the Internet Editions or derivative works thereof to the Distribution Point by the consent of the Maintainer.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-4">2.3</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and Illustrators retain all other rights to their respective portions of the Internet Editions not covered by this License. The Authors or Illustrators may, at any time, without notice and without need to show due cause, revoke the rights granted to you by this License to their respective portions of the Internet Editions.</p>
<h4><a name="lic-2-5">2.4</a></h4>

<p>If a person is under the legal age to be able to enter into a contractual relationship as defined by the laws of the area in which that person resides, they may have a parent or legal guardian agree to be bound by the terms and obligations of this License. On condition of agreeing to be bound by the terms of the License, that same parent or legal guardian may thereafter give a copy or copies of the Internet Editions to that child. That parent or legal guardian is thereafter legally responsible to ensure that that child behaves in accordance with all of the terms and obligations of this License.</p>
<p>The authority of a parent or legal guardian to distribute the Internet Editions does not extend to the distribution of the Internet Editions to any other person or persons except his or her child or legal dependent.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-3">3. Termination of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-3-0">3.0</a></h4>

<h3><a name="lic-4">4. Jurisdiction</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-4-0">4.0</a></h4>

<p>If, in consequence of court judgement or the laws of a particular area, any portion of the License is held as invalid or unenforceable in any particular circumstance, you are no longer granted any rights under the terms of this License in that circumstance. You agree to act in accordance with section 3.0 for all copies of the Internet Editions for which the License is held as invalid or unenforceable as if you had violated the terms and obligations of the License. The License is intended to remain in force in all other circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-5">5. Revision of the License</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-5-0">5.0</a></h4>

<p>The Authors and the Illustrators may publish revisions of this License in the future to address new concerns. Any further revisions will be legally binding at the time that you receive notification in any form of the revision.</p>
<h3><a name="lic-6">6. NO WARRANTY</a></h3>

<h4><a name="lic-6-0">6.0</a></h4>

<p>BECAUSE THE INTERNET EDITIONS ARE LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE INTERNET EDITIONS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE INTERNET EDITIONS "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
